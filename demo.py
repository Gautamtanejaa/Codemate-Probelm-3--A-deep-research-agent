    Introduction to Machine Learning

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers 
    to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. 
    It has revolutionized many industries including healthcare, finance, and technology.

    Types of Machine Learning:

    1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from 
       inputs to outputs. Examples include classification and regression.

    2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. 
       Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

    3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment, 
       receiving rewards or penalties for actions.

    Popular Algorithms:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forest
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Neural Networks
    - K-Means Clustering

    Applications:
    - Image recognition and computer vision
    - Natural language processing
    - Recommendation systems
    - Fraud detection
    - Medical diagnosis
    - Autonomous vehicles

    The future of machine learning looks promising with advances in deep learning, 
    quantum computing, and edge AI deployment.
